## Database Setup (SQL)
```
DB_CLIENT=
DB_HOST=
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DATABASE=
```

## Port Setup
You can setup your port from .env rather than changing it in your code:

```
PORT=
```

## JWT Expiration Time
You can simply set a global expiration time for JWT which you can continually reference like so:

```
JWT_EXP=your-jwt-expiration-time
```
